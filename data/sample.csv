It looks like the migration we ran last night for the 'Global Search' feature didn't include the necessary composite index on the 'tenant_id' and 'deleted_at' columns. James, can you pull the slow query logs from CloudWatch?"
2,true,James (Lead Dev),,2025-11-01 08:32:44,"On it, Sarah. I see the culprit. The query optimizer is doing a full table scan on the 'Events' table because of the polymorphic association. I'm writing a hotfix migration now to add a partial index. Should be ready for staging in 10 minutes."

Dear Alex, We’ve been closely monitoring ScaleFlow’s trajectory over the last two quarters. Your recent expansion into the EMEA market has caught our attention. To prepare for our internal partner meeting on Friday, could you share your updated 'Data Room'? We specifically need: 1. A monthly breakdown of NRR (Net Revenue Retention) for the last 12 months. 2. Your current SOC2 Type II compliance status. 3. Engineering headcount projections for the next 18 months. We believe your 'AI-driven Orchestration' layer is a category-defining product and are eager to discuss a potential Series A lead. Best regards, Mark Stevenson, General Partner."

6,true,Maya (Dev),,2025-11-01 09:45:30,"James, I’ve reviewed the migration for the index. It looks solid, but I'm worried about the lock time on a table with 50 million rows.

Analysis: Your expansion revenue from existing customers grew by $8k this week, largely due to seat additions in the 'FinTech' segment.

Specifically, they need to be able to define 'Viewer' vs 'Editor' roles at the project level, integrated with their Okta SSO. They mentioned that without this, their InfoSec team will block the deal. Do we have this on the roadmap for this month?"

19,true,Sarah (CTO),,2025-11-01 14:20:00,"Alex, full RBAC with SSO is a month-long project if we do it right. We'd need to refactor our entire permissioning middleware.

34,true,Sarah (CTO),,2025-11-02 10:20:30,"Looking at the logs. The session timeouts are happening because the Redis cluster is overwhelmed. We’re using the same Redis instance for both the 'ProductHunt Landing Page' cache and 'User Sessions'. The PH traffic is crowding out the actual app users. I’m spinning up a separate Redis instance for sessions now to isolate the traffic."
