### Subject
**ScaleFlow: $5.4M ARR, 143% NRR, and Series A Term Sheet**

### Body
Hi [Investor Name],

I’m reaching out because ScaleFlow’s growth velocity has accelerated significantly over the last quarter, and we have just secured a **Series A term sheet ($15M @ $80M valuation)**.

We are currently finalizing the round and are looking to bring on a select group of strategic partners who understand the enterprise infrastructure space.

**Key Traction Highlights:**

*   **Revenue Growth:** We recently hit a peak of **$450k MRR** (~$5.4M ARR), driven by our new Causal Engine and Real-time Collaboration modules.
*   **Best-in-Class Retention:** Our Net Revenue Retention (NRR) reached a record **143%** in October, demonstrating massive expansion revenue within our existing cohorts.
*   **Enterprise Validation:** We have secured commitments from **Delta Airlines, FedEx, and Walmart**, with active late-stage pilots at Goldman Sachs, Uber, and Airbnb.
*   **Technical Moat:** Our proprietary 'Causal Consistency' engine is now handling over **25,000 concurrent WebSockets** at scale. To support this, we are onboarding senior engineering talent, including alumni from the Google Spanner team.

We have proven product-market fit with Fortune 500 clients and the unit economics to scale efficiently. 

I’d love to find 15 minutes this week to walk you through the deck and discuss the remaining allocation in the round.

Best,

**Alex**
CEO, ScaleFlow
