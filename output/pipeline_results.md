### Subject
**ScaleFlow: $5.4M ARR, 141% NRR, and Major Enterprise Wins**

### Body
Hi [Investor Name],

I’m writing to share some recent milestones at ScaleFlow. We have just crossed **$450k MRR ($5.4M ARR)**, driven by a breakout month where we saw Net Revenue Retention (NRR) hit **141%**.

Following our #1 launch on ProductHunt and a successful technical deep dive with Sequoia, we have secured a Series A term sheet. We are now moving quickly to close the round and wanted to connect regarding the remaining allocation.

**Recent Commercial Traction:**
*   **Enterprise Wins:** We have confirmed contracts moving forward with **Delta Airlines** and **Goldman Sachs** (for our API v2), alongside wins with FedEx and Shopify.
*   **Pipeline Explosion:** Our enterprise pipeline has grown 400%, with active late-stage discussions with JPMC, Airbnb, and Uber.
*   **Retention:** Our churn remains exceptionally low (~1.0 - 1.7%), validating strong product-market fit in the enterprise segment.

**Technical Validation:**
*   **Scale:** Our infrastructure is now successfully handling peaks of **~25,000 concurrent WebSockets** with real-time latency reduced to 85ms.
*   **Moat:** Our proprietary Causal Consistency engine has been technically audited and validated as a key differentiator against incumbents.

We are capitalizing on this momentum to expand our engineering team and close the integration gaps (Snowflake/Databricks) requested by our Fortune 500 prospects.

Are you available for a brief call this Tuesday or Thursday to discuss the round?

Best,

Alex
CEO, ScaleFlow
